# Artistic Coloring Book

This project provides a basic coloring book application implemented with `tkinter`.
It includes a simple gallery, coloring workspace with palette, zoom controls, texture overlay, and image saving.

## Requirements
- Python 3 with `tkinter`
- Optional: `Pillow` library for saving directly to PNG or JPEG (`pip install Pillow`)

## Running
Execute the application with:

```bash
python3 coloring_book.py
```

If `Pillow` is not installed, artwork is saved as PostScript (`.ps`).
Use an external tool to convert it to PNG or JPEG if needed.
